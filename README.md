# ArduinoSnapTap
A simple implementation of razer's new firmware "SnapTap" (Null binds) for any keyboard with the use of an Arduino Leonardo and a USB Host shield

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Leonardo
- USB Host Shield

## Guide
- Assemble Arduino leonardo and your USB Host Shield as shown in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dxwU87GQVM
- Plug any USB keyboard into the USB Host Shield
- Plug the Arduino Leonardo into your computer
- Install the Arduino IDE (1.X.X reccomended)
- Open main.ino

## Why?
What razer is doing by using their power to make extra abilities that used to be considered as cheats, to now be considered as exclusive features that only the richest, most commited gamers can use doesn't sit right with me.
